# Astervoids

Built with SpriteKit. 

Fly through asteroids, try not to get hit. 

Tap to fire. Swipe left or right to move. Future versions will use motion, tilt
left/right, to move. At the moment I'm having Code Signing issues and can't 
haven't been able to get this running on my phone. 

## Configure your ship

Swipe down to show the ship configuration screen. Here you can choose one of three
ship configuration schemes. 

- Speed > Power - Moves faster shots are weaker
- Speed = Power - Speed and weapon are average
- Speed > Power - Speed is a slow weapon is more powerful

In the future this screen will represent power allocation inthe ship for more 
complex and detail configuration. 

Swipe up to dismiss this menu.
